    // Precision landing's second phase, run right after DeorbitBurn finishes and before the
    // normal Pause -> QuickWarp -> RotationWarp -> Waiting -> Brake -> TouchDown sequence starts.
    //
    // The deorbit burn's targeting has to commit to a burn based on a PREDICTION (where
    // FindBestDeorbitBurn's search thinks the resulting trajectory will land), so any error in
    // that prediction, or in flying the burn itself, otherwise falls entirely on the descent-phase
    // steering (TouchDown.ComputeSteeredDirection) to fix late, close to the ground, where there's
    // the least room (time, altitude, fuel budget) left to correct. This phase does that
    // correcting soon after the deorbit burn instead, while there's still plenty of altitude and
    // time, so the descent only has to mop up whatever small residual is left.
    //
    // Re-runs the exact same search DeorbitBurn already uses (LandingTargeting.
    // FindBestDeorbitBurn) - not new math - but against the REAL, already-flown post-deorbit-burn
    // orbit instead of a pre-burn prediction, over a short, near-term window instead of a full
    // orbit. Since periapsis is already set close to the target depth by the deorbit burn,
    // ComputeDeorbitDeltaV's prograde/retrograde component for these candidates should come out
    // small - this is mostly the plane-trim component doing real work a second time, now against
    // whatever the deorbit burn actually achieved (including its own execution error). If the
    // deorbit burn already nailed it, this phase finds nothing useful to do and falls straight
    // through to Pause (see the "nothing meaningful to correct" branch in Start() below) - it
    // should never make things worse, only sometimes do nothing.
    //
    // NOT a substitute for starting Brake earlier - checkDirection() in TouchDown.cs deliberately
    // holds the engine off (SetThrottle(0), no steering at all) until the vessel's actual velocity
    // is already predominantly downward (see its "Waiting for speed Down" branch), specifically to
    // avoid thrusting into a climb on a low-gravity body. Right after a deorbit burn the vessel is
    // still mostly horizontal/outbound for a good stretch, so entering Brake early would just idle
    // doing nothing until the same natural falling point Brake already starts near today - it
    // wouldn't buy any extra correction time. A real, separately-sized burn (this phase) is what
    // actually spends dV early instead of late.
    //
    // Mirrors DeorbitBurn.cs's own structure (own Turn/Warp/Burn instances rather than
    // NodeExPilot, for the same K2D2_Plugin.ResetControllers() reason - see DeorbitBurn's comment).
